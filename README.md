# SadSurfTimer for CS:GO

![lul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qawery-just-sad/Surftimer-Official/alternate-universe/.github/lul.png)

## Project Goals

Currently working on [adding prestrafe messages and compare also 128 checkpoints/stages and getting rid of old speed limiter](https://github.com/qawery-just-sad/Surftimer-Official/pull/48)

**Does it mean this version is buggy?**

Maybe, it's less buggy than any other fork, and defo better than main repo

## **Pull requests and any contributions are (not) welcome ~~and encouraged!~~ ~~(if you wanna contribute go there and help those poor souls https://github.com/surftimer/Surftimer-official)~~**
Why? because [I](https://github.com/qawery-just-sad) believe in proprietary software (sorry open source guys u suck and u don't even know how much), If I see that your pr is good I might consider adding it but it's not a guarantee.
Also don't think that anyone at this point wanna help this project, if you wanna be helpful go to [Bara's discord](https://discord.gg/f96vDPMa7P) and help him with [fuckTimer](https://github.com/fuckTimer).
